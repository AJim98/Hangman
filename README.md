## 1. Description
### 1.1 About
Hangman is a game where two or more players guess the letters in a word, before the hanged man is fully drawn. This project aim to recreate this game, where the computer randommly selects the word and the player must guess the word.

### 1.2 Project Goals
This project aims to showcase my understanding of python OOP fundamentals, using hangman as an example.

### 1.3 What I learnt
- Programming using classes and OOP.
- Handle errors.
- Git commands.

## 2. Playing Hangman
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open code editor and run "milestone5.py".
3. The game can now begin.
4. Enjoy.


## 3. Documentation
### milestone2.py
This file is the foundation for the project, where a list of words is created, from which a random word is seleceted. The user is also asked to input a single letter as well.

### milestone3.py
A while loop is used to check if the guess is in the word. 

### milestone4.py
A function for checking the guess and asking for user input is created, which is used to define what happens if the letter is or isn't in word.

### milestone6.py
A play_game function is added which breaks the game, aka exits the game depending on which of the conditions are met, either they run out of lives and lose or they guess all the letters correctly and win.





# Hangman
Demonstrated proficiency in the foundations in the principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) through the creation of a hangman game.
1. Built an implementation of the Hangman game in Python.
2. Implemented robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure seamless user interaction and gameplay.
3. Designed and executed logical structures, incorporating conditional statements to enhance user experience.
4. Used OOP principles including encapsulation and abstraction.

Please note that the full, completed Hangman game is saved as "milestone5.py".
